## Generating strategies automatically using few-shot prompting on GPT-3.5 Turbo
We use some of the hand-crafted strategies created for HumanEval to provide a few-shot prompt to GPT-3.5 Turbo for generating strategies for the Sanitized MBPP dataset. We then fuzz the ground truths available in MBPP using these strategies, and out of 427 strategies (for the 427 problems in sanitized MBPP), 364 strategies were valid. Of these, around 20 were later found to be buggy and were corrected. We then manually fixed the remaining strategies as well. Overall, we used more than 340/427 (about 80%) strategies generated by GPT-3.5 Turbo directly for our evaluation and manually **fixed** only the remaining strategies.

We then utilize the code samples for 22 (model, size, temperature) combinations provided with [EvalPlus v0.2.0](https://github.com/evalplus/evalplus/releases/tag/v0.2.0) to evaluate the samples using these strategies. There are 338 problems in the intersection of our strategies and the code samples provided by EvalPlus. This is the set of problems we use for our evaluation.
